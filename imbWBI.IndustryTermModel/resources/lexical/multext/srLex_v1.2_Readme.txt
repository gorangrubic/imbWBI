 Description
srLex is a large inflectional lexicon of Serbian language where each entry consists of a (wordform, lemma, MSD, frequency, per-million frequency) 5-tuple. The (wordform, lemma, MSD) triple frequencies are calculated on the srWaC v1.2 corpus. The MSD tagset follows the MULTEXT-East V5 tagset for Bosnian available at http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V5/msd/html/msd-bs.html.
